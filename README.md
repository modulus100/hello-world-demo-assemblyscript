# hello-world-demo-assemblyscript

This repository includes a complete project structure for AssemblyScript contracts targeting the NEAR platform.

The example here is very basic. It's a simple contract demonstrating the following concepts:

- a single contract
- the difference between `view` vs. `change` methods
- basic contract storage

## Usage

### Getting started

INSTALL `NEAR CLI` first like this: `npm i -g near-cli`

1. clone this repo to a local folder
2. run `yarn`
3. run `./scripts/1.dev-deploy.sh`
4. run `./scripts/2.use-contract.sh`
5. run `./scripts/2.use-contract.sh` (yes, run it to see changes)
6. run `./scripts/3.cleanup.sh`

# The Challenge

You should try completing the following 3 tasks one at a time. The answer is available for each, but don't look at them until you've tried your best. All 3 probably will only take you 15 minutes.

## Basic overview of the 3 tasks (which will be detailed in the following sections, so keep reading)

1. Change `helloWorld` method so it accepts parameter `name` and greets that person instead.
1. Change `helloWorld` method so it accepts parameter array `names` and greets each of those people.
1. Change `helloWorld` method so it reads the Account ID from Context and greets the account who called the function.

## Task 1 success criteria

- input:

```bash
near view $CONTRACT helloWorld '{"name": "Your Name"}'
```

- incorrect input (don't do it like this, which throws an error):

```bash
near view $CONTRACT helloWorld 'Your Name'
```

- output: `hello Your Name`

## Task 2 success criteria

- input:

```bash
near view $CONTRACT helloWorld '{"names": ["Your Name", "Friend Name"]}'
```

- incorrect input (don't do it like this, which throws an error):

```bash
near view $CONTRACT helloWorld "['Your Name', 'Friend Name']"
```

- output:

```
hello Your Name, hello Friend Name
```

**Bonus**
Try instead providing thousands of names in the array. Check the error, and learn why it has failed.

## Task 3 success criteria

- input: `near call $CONTRACT helloWorld --accountId <id>.testnet`
- output: `hello <id>.testnet`

## Other thoughts

You may want to consider using the command `npx asp --init`, which will create the following folders and files (see https://tenner-joshua.gitbook.io/as-pect/getting-started):

```
./assembly/
./assembly/tests/
./assembly/tests/example.spec.ts
./assembly/tests/as-pect.d.ts
```
